# Executive Summary {-}

The health and viability of freshwater fish populations can depend on access to tributary and off channel areas which provide refuge during high flows, opportunities for foraging, overwintering habitat, spawning habitat and summer rearing habitat. As road crossing structures are commonly upgraded or removed there are numerous opportunities to restore connectivity by ensuring that fish passage considerations are incorporated into repair, replacement, relocation and deactivation designs. 

<br>

The Society for Ecosystem Restoration in Northern BC (SERNbc) is working together with the McLeod Lake Indian Band, the Peace Region Fish and Wildlife Compensation Program (FWCP), the Provincial Fish Passage Technical Working Group (FPTWG), Ministry of Forests, road/rail tenure holders and other FWCP stakeholders/partners to prioritize, plan and fund the restoration of fish passage at Parsnip River watershed road crossing structure barriers. 

<br>

The project engages FWCP partners and stakeholders to clearly communicate fish passage issues in the Parsnip River watershed while collaboratively planning and executing the steps necessary to realize fish passage restorations. Work completed and ongoing aligns with the Fish and Wildlife Compensation Program Rivers, Lakes and Reservoirs Action Plan [@fishandwildlifecompensationprogram2020PeaceRegion] sub objective 6 of addressing fish passage issues in streams to enhance productivity of priority species.  Project activities undertaken address the following actions:

  * PEA.RLR.S06.RI.20 - Conducting engagement to prioritize options for fish passage improvement-P1 
  * PEA.RLR.S06.RI.19 - Conducting research to prioritize fish passage actions-P1
  * PEA.RLR.S06.HB.21 - Restoring fish access to streams-P1

This project builds on Society for Ecosystem Restoration Northern BC (SERNbc) work in 2018 - 2019 and 2021 - 2022 which can be referenced [here](https://newgraphenvironment.github.io/Parsnip_Fish_Passage/) [@irvine2020ParsnipRiver] and [here](https://newgraphenvironment.github.io/fish_passage_parsnip_2021_reporting/) [@irvine2022PEAF22F3577DCARestoring].

Through 2022/2023 project activities numerous project partners were engaged and we were able to identify and conduct fish passage planning/restoration activities at multiple high priority sites. 

- At PSCIS crossing 125179 - a tributary to Missinka River, twin culverts that were negatively impacting fish passage were replaced with a clear-span bridge.  
- Two crossings on the Chuchinka-Table FSR were prepared for replacement with engineering designs commissioned and construction materials purchased by Canfor with support through this project.
- Numerous sites were assessed in the field including those identified through 2021/2022 planning activities and sites where data collected can be utilized in future years to understand the severity of connnectivity issues and help evaluate the effectiveness of investments. 

<br>

Although an engineering design was commissioned by Sinclar Group to facilitate replacement of high priority PSCIS crossing 125000 on the Chuchinka-Arctic FSR in 2022, installation of the clearspan structure has been delayed because of changes in plans for logging beyond the stream due to old growth referrals. The British Columbia government has asked licensees to defer harvest of these areas until "partners develop a new approach for old growth forest management". 

<br>

British Columbia Timber Sales is planning to deactivate the Chuchinka-Colbourne FSR between the location of high priority PSCIS crossing 125345 on a tributary to the Parsnip River and the Chuchinka-Anzac FSR. Included in the deactivation is removal of crossing 125345.  The work was scheduled for July and August of 2022 but has been rescheduled for this year due to a road washout in 2022. 

<br>

In addition to structure replacements and removals to restore connectivity, research and monitoring is an essential part of any restoration program and is necessary to ensure that we identify the best and most efficient opportunities for fish passage restoration while incorporating adaptive management informed by traditional knowledge and real-time planning/monitoring data. Recommendations going forward include:

- Continue to engage partners to raise funds for remediations, identify sites for restoration, conduct remedial works and assess effectiveness of works. 
- Continue to conduct detailed assessments where blockages are present and large amounts of habitat are potentially available within the Parsnip River, Carp Lake and Crooked River watershed groups.  As timelines for remediations can be extensive, planning onerous and costs of remedial works significant, assessments within the Carp Lake and Crooked River watershed groups will provide more options for remediation and engage additional funding partners (ex. Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure, alternative forest licensees). Additionally, identifying areas of concern near the community of McLeod Lake is expected to further engage community members and most effectively promote restoration activities.
- Conduct baseline monitoring where sites have been prioritized and where remediations are planned. Electrofishing surveys including tagging of target species with PIT tags are recommended to understand the extent of connectivity impairments, track fish movement/health over time and inform adaptive management. Photo documentation of stream morphology near crossings is also recommended. 
 
  - Of particular priority for baseline monitoring is PSCIS crossing 125231 on a tributary to the Table River as this will likely be the first remediation to be completed in 2024. 
  - As fish were tagged with PIT tags at site 125000 on the tributary to Parsnip River located on the Chuchinka-Arctic FSR in 2022 it is recommended that the site be reassessed with electrofishing in the 2023 and/or 2024 to provide valuable information regarding how the perched culvert may be impacting fish movement and health. 
- Conduct follow up monitoring at site 125179 in the Missinka where the bridge was installed in 2022. Electrofishing with tagging of target species is recommended along with photo documentation of stream morphology near the bridge. Fish sampling in the adjacent similar sized stream [(PSCIS crossing 125180)](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/Parsnip_Fish_Passage/03_Parsnip_report_125180.html) containing culverts ranked as barriers can provide reference site data for comparison.
