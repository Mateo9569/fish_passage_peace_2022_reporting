## Site Location {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()`, on
`r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)`.
The site is approximately
`r round(fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = downstream_route_measure)*0.001, 1)`km
upstream from the confluence with the Missinka River.

<br>

## Background {.unnumbered}

At crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a
`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() %>% english::ordinal()` order stream with a
watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The elevation of the watershed ranges from
a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_min')`m near the crossing (Table
\@ref(tab:tab-wshd-125194)). Upstream of crossing
`r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_fish_sp()` have previously
been recorded [@moe2020; @norris2022].

```{r tab-wshd-125194, eval = T}
fpr::fpr_table_wshd_sum(site_id = my_site) %>% 
  fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0('Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing ', my_site, '.'),
           footnote_text = 'Elev P60 = Elevation at which 60% of the watershed area is above',
           scroll = F)

```

A summary of habitat modelling outputs is presented in Table
\@ref(tab:tab-culvert-bcfp-125194) and a map of the watershed is
provided in map attachment
[`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = dbm_mof_50k_grid)`](fpr::fpr_my_mapsheet()).

## Stream Characteristics at Crossing {.unnumbered}

At the time of the survey, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was
un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result) %>% stringr::str_to_lower()`
to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol
[@moe2011] (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-125194)). Water
temperature was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'temperature_c')`$^\circ$C, pH
was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'p_h')` and conductivity was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'conductivity_m_s_cm')`uS/cm.

## Stream Characteristics Downstream {.unnumbered}

`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-125194-01) - \\@ref(fig:photo-125194-02)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-125194-d01))."))`
`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'ds')` There was abundant woody debris that added complexity to the stream habitat and provided cover for resident fish. There were trace undercut banks and pools that were suitable for rearing. Abundant gravels were present that would be suitable for spawning. The habitat
was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds')` value for
salmonid rearing and spawning.

## Stream Characteristics Upstream {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'us')` `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-125194-03) - \\@ref(fig:photo-125194-06)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-125194-d02))."))`
`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'us')` The water was tinged brown at the time of survey; likely from beaver activity upstream. No gravels were present suitable for spawning and the substrate was composed primarily of angular rock. Several rock steps of 50-60cm high were present in first 300m of survey that would prevent upstream juvenile salmonid migration. Large beaver dam and empoundment at modelled crossing 16601526. Overall, the habitat surveyed upstream of the crossing
rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us')` value as an important
migration corridor containing habitat suitable for spawning with moderate rearing potential.

## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {.unnumbered}

## Conclusion {.unnumbered}

Modelling indicates 
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull= upstream_habitat_length_m)`km of
habitat upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)` suitable for bull trout rearing with
areas surveyed rated as
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site, loc = 'us', col_pull = hab_value)`
value for rearing and spawning. Crossing
`r as.character(my_site)` was ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull = priority)` priority for
proceeding to design for replacement.
