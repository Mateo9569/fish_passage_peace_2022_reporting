1,Tributary to Parsnip River,6745_ds,6745,ds,,2022-08-14,14:40:00,AI MW,200,medium,,,,,Moderate to low value habitat due to low flow volumes and lack of pools. Surveyed downstream for 200 m. Smaller and narrower than upstream. Abundant undercut banks for juvenile rearing. Small gravels suitable for smaller fish.
2,Tributary to Parsnip River,6745_us,6745,us,,2022-08-14,11:56:00,AI MW,550,medium,,,,,"Moderate value habitat.  Surveyed upstream for 550 m. Small perennial stream. Abundant gravel present, suitable for resident rainbow. Some deep pools up to 45 cm suitable for rearing, nice undercut banks. Larger gravel about 30 cm in size."
3,Fern Creek,125261_ds,125261,ds,,2022-08-15,17:12:00,AI MW,150,high,,,,,High value habitat. Extensive gravels in first 150 m downstream then transitions to wetland type with depths to 1 m on floodplain of table. Both gps' nad cameras used.
4,Fern Creek,125261_us,125261,us,,2022-08-15,15:35:00,AI MW,250,high,,,,,"High value habitat. Surveyed upstream for 250 m. Large stream with abundant gravel suitable for spawning, deep pools for overwintering. Numerous fish observed, stable with large woody debris throughout, numerous undercut banks."
5,Tributary to Missinka River,125194_ds,125194,ds,,2022-08-17,15:06:00,AI MW,250,medium,,,,,Medium value habitat. Lots of LWD and SWD that can provide cover. Some undercut banks and pools that are suitable for rearing. Fines and gravels throughout suitable for spawning.
6,Tributary to Missinka River,125194_us,125194,us,,2022-08-17,15:13:00,AI MW,500,medium,,,,,Note that there were fry observed upstream and downstream of crossing 125170 and make minimal site for that crossing which is not related to this site but was visited earlier on the same day. Medium value habitat. Water is tinged brown likely from beaver activity upstream. No gravels suitable for spawning and substrate is composed primarily of angular rock. Several rock steps of 50-60 high (in first 300m) that would prevent upstream juvenile salmonid migration. Large beaver dam and empoundment at modelled crossing 16601526.
